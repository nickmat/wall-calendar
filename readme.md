# wall-calendar

This is a program to create a wall calender in the form of a web page.

It is written in the Glich Script language
and is intended to serve as an example of its use.

### Running Glich Script

Glich Script is a spinoff from the [HistoryCal Program](https://github.com/nickmat/HistoryCal).
During the development of the Cal library and HistoryCal GUI program,
a command line program was also being developed.
This was mainly being used for quick tests but since version 0.3,
the test program and interactive program have been separated.
With version V0.1.0 of HistoryCal, the script language was spun off
to its own project and renamed [Glich](https://nickmat.github.io/glich/website/index.htm)

The [Gliched](https://nickmat.github.io/gliched/index.htm) IDE can be used to edit and run the script.

The `cal/images` pictures can be changed as required,

Running this script should result in 12 output files and a full year page [cal/cal-2020.htm](https://nickmat.github.io/wall-calendar/cal/cal-2024.htm). The pages are designed to be printed on A4 or A3 paper. Some adjustment would be required for other page sizes.
